# FlaskPlots

It is a project for presentation basic plotting functions with using ```matplotlib``` library in a microframework Flask.



## Setup environment

It is highly recommended to use, ```requirements.txt``` file to get all necessary modules.



## Technologies used

Basicly I have used Flask to play with this framework a little bit. 
WTForms helped to build simple forms, Jinja2 parsed logic into HTML files.
Other scientific tools such as numpy and matplotlib were used to generate plots.
Base64 is an built-in library for image handling.
